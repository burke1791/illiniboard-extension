# Illiniboard Browser Extension

An extension for [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Brave](https://brave.com/) web browsers that keeps you up to date on new articles posted to illiniboard.com

## Why should I download this extension?

By regularly polling Illiniboard's RSS feed, it will know when a new article has been posted and show a badge on the extension to let you know.

Keeps track of the articles you've read and shows you the three most recent posts you haven't read.  If you don't have a subscription, it will also keep track of the number of free articles left for the month.
